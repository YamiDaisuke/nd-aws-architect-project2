"AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."

"Given the budget increase I have keeped db.r5.4xlarge from previous step but adding a new read replica in the main region. On top of that I have duplicated the number of EC2 instances for Web and Application servers (from the original 16 to 32). Finally I have decided to include a second region redundant infrastructure, this includes one replica of our database a hot standby of our Web and Application servers with the same number of instances (32 each), Application load balancers and NAT Gateways"
